# Introduction to Node.js and Protocols
In this exercise we will have a look at how (mainly HTTP) servers work.

## Exercises
1. Download the node.js executable from [here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v4.0.0/win-x64/), and save it to U:\node\.

1. Download the latest NPM file from [here](http://nodejs.org/dist/npm/), and extract it in U:\node\.

1. Verify that node runs by typing 'node' at the command prompt.

1. Download telnet.js and run it by typing 'node telnet.js'. You will obviously have to 'cd' to the directory containing telnet.js first.

1. Try telneting to your server to verify it works.

1. Run http.js, and connect to the HTTP server using your browser.

## Advanced exercises

1. Change http.js to send HTML instead of just text.

1. Change Telnet.js to send "Hello, world!" after 3 seconds.

## Note

- U:\node\ has been added to your PATH by the technicians already.

- It's probably best to use Putty to Telnet into your Telnet server: [Putty Download Page](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).
